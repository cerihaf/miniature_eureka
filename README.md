# Note Taker

An interactive note taker app that allows you to write out notes and save them to a database.

## Description

When deploying the application it'll take you to the homepage where you click the "Get Started" button that will take you to the functional site. From there you'll be able to start typing out your note in the right column. You'll need to type something in the title and body section for the save button to appear in the top right corner. Once saved, the note title will pop up in the left hand column with a trash icon next to it for the option to delete. If you refresh the page the notes will remain because they are saved to the Heroku database.
